# UK Home Improvement Platform - Development Roadmap (Updated)

## Current State vs Vision Analysis (After Deployment Review)

### üö® **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

- **No User-Project Association**: Projects are not linked to users - any user can see all projects
- **No Authentication on Project Endpoints**: Projects API lacks user authentication and authorization
- **Data Privacy Violation**: Builders can see all homeowner projects, homeowners can see each other's projects
- **No Access Control**: No filtering based on user roles or permissions

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED FEATURES**

- **Requirement 1**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive Project Types (25+ implemented with enhanced UI)
- **Requirement 2**: ‚úÖ User Authentication (AWS Cognito with full registration/login flow)
- **Landing Page**: ‚úÖ Professional landing page with testimonials and CTAs implemented
- **Project Creation**: ‚úÖ 4-step workflow with enhanced project type selection
- **Project Dashboard**: ‚úÖ Basic project listing dashboard exists
- **Individual Project Pages**: ‚úÖ Route exists (`/projects/:projectId`) but needs enhancement
- **Builder Pages**: ‚úÖ Builder dashboard, profile, and quote submission pages exist
- **SoW Review Page**: ‚úÖ Basic SoW display page exists
- **Infrastructure**: ‚úÖ AWS serverless architecture fully deployed

### üîÑ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

- **Project Dashboard**: Basic project listing, needs to become the central project hub
- **Builder System**: Registration and basic dashboard exist, needs invitation system
- **SoW System**: Display components exist, needs AI generation backend
- **Quote System**: UI components exist, needs backend integration

### ‚ùå **MISSING CRITICAL FEATURES**

- **AI-Powered SoW Generation Backend** (Core requirement)
- **Project-Centric Dashboard** (Central hub for project management)
- **AI-Driven Questionnaire System** (For project details collection)
- **Direct LLM Integration** (Before implementing AI agents)
- **Builder Invitation & Quote Management Backend**
- **Payment Processing** (Stripe integration)
- **Property Assessment & Compliance**
- **Contract Generation**
- **Analytics & Reporting**
- **Communication System**

---

## üéØ **REVISED STRATEGY: PROJECT-CENTRIC DEVELOPMENT**

### **Core Philosophy**

The **Individual Project Page** (`/projects/:projectId`) becomes the **central hub** where homeowners:

1. **Complete project details** through AI-guided questionnaires
2. **Generate SoW** with direct LLM calls (not agents initially)
3. **Invite builders** and manage quotes
4. **Track project progress** through all phases

### **Technical Approach**

- **Direct LLM Integration**: Use OpenAI/Claude API calls initially, implement AI agents later
- **Project-Centric UI**: All functionality revolves around the individual project dashboard
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Build on existing pages rather than creating new ones

---

## üó∫Ô∏è **REVISED INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP**

### **PHASE 0: CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES (Week 1) - IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**

#### **Sprint 0.1: User-Project Association & Authentication**

**Prompt for AWS Q CLI:**

CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Implement proper user-project association and authentication:
1. Add JWT token validation to all project endpoints in Lambda
2. Extract userId from Cognito JWT token for all authenticated requests
3. Modify project creation to store userId with each project
4. Update project retrieval to filter by userId (homeowners see only their projects)
5. Add userType extraction from JWT to differentiate homeowners vs builders
6. Implement proper access control:
   - Homeowners: Can create, see, and edit their own projects
   - Builders: Can only view projects they've been invited to and submit quotes (cannot create projects)
7. Add database migration to associate existing projects with users (if any test data exists)
8. Update frontend to send Authorization header with JWT token
9. Add proper error handling for unauthorized access attempts
10. Test thoroughly to ensure no data leakage between users
```

3. Add project ownership validation (only project owner can invite builders)
4. Create secure project sharing mechanism for builder invitations
5. Add audit logging for all project access attempts
6. Implement role-based permissions (homeowner: create/edit projects vs builder: view/quote only)
7. Add project privacy settings and access controls
8. Create secure API endpoints for builder project access
9. Add proper error messages for access denied scenarios
10. Ensure complete data isolation between different users and user types
```

### **PHASE 1: Project Dashboard as Central Hub (Weeks 2-4)**

#### **Sprint 1.1: Enhanced Project Dashboard Foundation**

**Prompt for AWS Q CLI:**

```
Transform the existing ProjectDashboardPage (/projects/:projectId) into a comprehensive project management hub:
1. When projectId is provided, show individual project dashboard with sections for:
   - Project overview (type, address, status)
   - Project details collection (AI-guided questionnaire)
   - SoW generation section (with "Generate SoW" button)
   - Builder invitation section (initially disabled until SoW ready)
   - Project timeline and status tracking
2. When no projectId (dashboard route), show project listing as currently implemented
3. Add project status states: "Details Collection", "SoW Generation", "SoW Ready", "Builders Invited", "Quotes Received"
4. Create tabbed interface for different project phases
5. Maintain all existing project listing functionality
6. Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop
```

#### **Sprint 1.2: AI-Guided Project Questionnaire System**
