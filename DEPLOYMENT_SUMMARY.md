# Secure Builder Invitation System - Deployment Summary

## ✅ Successfully Deployed Components

### 1. Database Infrastructure
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed
- **Stack**: `uk-home-improvement-builder-invitations`
- **Tables Created**:
  - `builder-invitations` - Stores invitation codes and metadata
  - `project-access` - Manages builder access to specific projects  
  - `project-quotes` - Stores submitted quotes from builders
- **Indexes**: All necessary GSI indexes created for efficient querying

### 2. Backend API (Lambda Function)
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed
- **Function**: `uk-home-api`
- **New Endpoints Added**:
  - `POST /projects/{projectId}/invitations` - Generate invitation codes
  - `GET /projects/{projectId}/invitations` - Get project invitations
  - `POST /invitations/validate` - Validate invitation codes
  - `POST /invitations/accept` - Accept invitations (existing builders)
  - `GET /builder/projects` - Get builder's accessible projects
  - `GET /builder/projects/{projectId}` - Get project details for builders
  - `POST /builder/projects/{projectId}/quotes` - Submit quotes
  - `GET /projects/{projectId}/quotes` - Get project quotes (owners)

### 3. Frontend Application
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed
- **S3 Bucket**: `uk-home-frontend-1756487157`
- **CloudFront**: Cache invalidated for immediate availability
- **New Features**:
  - Enhanced registration with builder invitation code support
  - Builder dashboard with project invitation functionality
  - Secure project view for invited builders
  - Quote submission interface
  - Project owner quote management and comparison

## 🌐 Live URLs

- **Frontend**: https://d41avezevb35d.cloudfront.net
- **API**: https://rdy68tyyp1.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod
- **Health Check**: https://rdy68tyyp1.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/health

## 🔧 System Architecture

### Security Features
- ✅ One-time invitation codes with 7-day expiration
- ✅ Project access isolation (builders can only see invited projects)
- ✅ JWT-based authentication for all operations
- ✅ Project ownership validation
- ✅ Secure code generation using UUID

### User Flows
1. **Homeowner Flow**:
   - Create project → Generate SoW → Invite builders → Compare quotes
   
2. **New Builder Flow**:
   - Receive invitation code → Register with code → Auto-access project → Submit quote
   
3. **Existing Builder Flow**:
   - Receive invitation code → Login → Add code via dashboard → Access project → Submit quote

## 📊 Database Schema

### builder-invitations
```
id (PK), projectId (GSI), invitationCode (GSI), builderEmail, 
status, createdAt, expiresAt, acceptedAt, acceptedBy, createdBy
```

### project-access
```
id (PK), projectId (GSI), builderId (GSI), accessType, 
grantedAt, invitationId
```

### project-quotes
```
id (PK), projectId (GSI), builderId (GSI), totalCost, laborCost, 
materialsCost, timeline, description, status, submittedAt
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Completed Tests
- [x] Database tables created successfully
- [x] Lambda function updated with new endpoints
- [x] Frontend built and deployed without errors
- [x] CloudFront cache invalidated
- [x] API health check responding correctly

### 🔄 Ready for User Testing
- [ ] Generate invitation code as homeowner
- [ ] Register new builder with invitation code
- [ ] Existing builder accepts invitation code
- [ ] Builder submits quote for invited project
- [ ] Homeowner views and compares quotes
- [ ] Access control validation (unauthorized access attempts)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **User Acceptance Testing**: Test all user flows with real scenarios
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor API response times and error rates
3. **Security Audit**: Validate access controls and invitation code security
4. **Email Integration**: Add automated email sending for invitations
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure responsive design works on all devices

## 📈 Monitoring & Maintenance

- **CloudWatch Logs**: Monitor Lambda function logs for errors
- **DynamoDB Metrics**: Track table performance and capacity
- **CloudFront Analytics**: Monitor frontend usage and performance
- **Cost Optimization**: Review AWS costs and optimize as needed

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Invitation codes expire automatically after 7 days
- All API endpoints require valid JWT authentication
- Project access is strictly controlled and validated
- Builders cannot enumerate or discover uninvited projects
- All operations are logged for audit purposes
